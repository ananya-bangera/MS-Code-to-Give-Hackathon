            <div>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe every child has the right to fulfil her aspirations and our credo has always been ‘Once a St. Judes child is always a St. Judes child’. In keeping with this vision, our new vertical St. Judes for Life has been established in the memory of  {<DesignBox text = {'Mrs. Rani Vicaji'}/>}, to ensure that these children who have won the battle against cancer are able to fulfil their potential. They come from underprivileged families who had made great sacrifices to ensure that the child was treated successfully for cancer. We have learnt of several new challenges they may face while they try to become self-reliant and independent. To this end our new vertical, {<DesignBox text = {'St. Judes'}/>} for Life will continue to provide support to our recovered as need arises.

    disease and leading a full, healthy, and happy life. The children come from underprivileged families who had made great sacrifices to
